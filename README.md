# Pickit - Smart Grocery Basket
## “A Fastrack for Shopping”


### Problem Statement :- 
A prototype, Pickit, that identifies grocery items and recommends items based on prior purchase history and providing item location.

### Significance and Proposed Scope :-
Smart Grocery Detection is essential to a grocery store's capacity to manage its workforce effectively. Real-time information on item availability is needed to 
determine when to redesign or replenish an item. As a result, the customer can always find the item on the rack when they need it. This study focuses on managing 
product displays at a grocery shop to decide how much of a specific product to stock on the shelves.
1. There are lot of limitations with the ordinary grocery stores and online delivery stores, we propose a model which can solve much of these limitations.
2. Most of the time even though there are number of salespersons, the user finds it difficult to locate the product in a grocery store. Sometimes the crowd in the store interacting with salespeople makes it difficult for other users in the shop. Moreover, it creates an unfriendly environment sometimes. Also, people from out of the state finds it difficult to communicate with salesperson. Our model can give the user the location of items.
3. ‘Time is money’ -usually a lot of time is wasted searching for the products in grocery stores and even if it is from an online store, there are chances for 
unpredictable delays. Our proposed model ensures no wastage of time as one can select items easily within a short span of time.
4. Once we are trying to shop things online, when we select a grocery item there aren’t many apps which recommend other products based on our selected item, i.e., if we are selecting items for breakfast -if we select bread, it won’t recommend items related to it like egg or milk, our model could recommend items based on the items we have taken first.
5. When users want to order a lot of items ,there is a limit or orders in online shopping and it won’t be practical in case of bulk orders and if we are buying from an ordinary store, there are chances users might forget some items to buy .If a user uses our model, even if the user remembers some of the items to be bought, our model could recommend other items which are in high correlation with it, so one don’t need to remember all the items to be bought.
6. People prefer online stores to ordinary stores nowadays because of the time wastage and difficulty for selecting items in ordinary store, even though ordinary stores are perfect for quality check. Our model ensures good quality products within the shortest span of time.
“Prefer Normal to Pareto-the high standardized grocery shops have good partnership deals with the renowned online delivery apps and they get good market from online trade too. The local retailers find it difficult to compete with the higher class. Our model could be helpful to this class of people and making the middle-class people get better would be preferable than making the rich richer. It could be beneficial for the economy of country as well”
